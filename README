About:
    The idea was that the 'tiny world' in question was a kid's backyard. The 
game follows the kid's journey from the wood pile at the back of the yard, 
through the perils that one might encounter on the way to dinner, which of 
course he can't be late too. The bugs were just stuff I remember running into
where I grew up. Those red centipedes that were under everything and the 
hairy caterpillars that gave you blisters XD
    This is my first game. I'm an application and automation developer but 
I wanted to take this opportunity to cram a bunch of game making knowledge
into my head and get a product out. I will definitely be back for another 
Ludum Dare!

    PS: Sorry if you have trouble running the game, I didn't have any time
at the end to get a package ready. Maybe next time. Also didn't have time to 
place the number of seconds left at the end.
